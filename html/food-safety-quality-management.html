			<p class="opening-paragraph">
			The international Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided in 2001 to develop a new food safety management system standard, based on Codex Alimentarius (FAO/WHO), HACCP & ISO 9001 to provide a common approach. ISO 22000 was hence created to harmonize requirements on a global level making standards work for people and business. ISO 22000 provides a framework for food sector organizations and authorities. 
			</p>
			
			<h3 class="paragraph-header">Who should use ISO 22000:2005</h3>
			
			<p>ISO 22000 is a food safety management standard used by organizations involved in the food chain independent of their complexity or size.  The food chain consists of the sequence of operations involved in the creation and consumption of food products. This includes every step from initial production to final consumption; from “Farm to Fork”, including <strong>production, processing, distribution, storage, and handling of all food and food ingredients.</strong> </p>
			
			<p>The food chain also includes organizations that do not directly handle food. These include animal feed producers as well as those who produce materials that come into contact with food or food ingredients such as packaging materials.</p>

			<h2 class="iso-header">HACCP design, implementation, training and auditing</h2>
			<h3 class="paragraph-header">What is HACCP?</h3>
			<p class="opening-paragraph">
			HACCP is a system that relies on process controls to minimize food safety risks in the food processing industry. The acronym HACCP stands for 'Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point' (pronounced 'hás•sip'). It is useful to think of HACCP as a preventative food safety system, and not a traditional quality control inspection system. HACCP is not 'zero risk' and does not eliminate the possibility of a hazard getting into the food product. Rather, HACCP attempts to decrease that possibility to an acceptable level.
			</p>

			<h3 class="paragraph-header">History of HACCP</h3>		
			<p>HACCP is not a new system. The concept was developed in the 1960s by the Pillsbury Company, while working with NASA and the US Army Laboratories to provide safe food for space expeditions. The limitations of end product testing became evident to those who were trying to provide the safest possible food products. In order to ensure that food used for space missions would be safe, almost all the product manufactured would need to be tested, leaving very little for actual use. A new approach was needed. The practical and proactive system of HACCP evolved from these efforts to understand and control food safety failures. HACCP has been widely used by industry since the late 1970s, and is now internationally recognized as the best system for ensuring food safety. </p>
			<h3 class="paragraph-header">Future of HACCP</h3>
			<p>Domestic and international food regulators are increasingly focused on HACCP as a mandatory requirement for food processors and food handlers. Additionally, we can expect HACCP or HACCP-type systems to be required in additional segments of the food system, including retail operations, packers, and farms. HACCP is a tool for managing food safety, and it is important to note that merely legislating HACCP does not guarantee food safety. For HACCP to be truly effective in a food handling or processing facility, the HACCP plan must be properly developed, effectively deployed, and continuously reviewed and improved. </p>
